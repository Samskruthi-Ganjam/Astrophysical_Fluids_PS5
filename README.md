List of python code files:

1. Advection.py : This code corresponds to section 3 of Problem Set 5. This is the solution to the Advection equation using FTCS and Lax-Friedrich methods.
2. AdvDiff.py : This code corresponds to section 4 of Problem Set 5. This is the solution to the Advection-Diffusion equation. 
3. Hydro.py : This code corresponds to section 5 of Problem Set 5. This is the code for the 1D Hydro Solver.

## 3. 1D Hydro solver (refer to code Hydro.py)

For a Gaussian perturbation in density with a small amplitude we see that the initial peak splits into two peaks of reduced amplitude, which travel outwards, 
reflect off the walls of the grid and move back towards the centre. As we increase the amplitude of the Gaussian perturbation, we see that 
the two travelling peaks steepen at one end which resembles a shock like feature. The width of this shock seems to be set by the strength of the perturbation 
i.e, the amplitude of the initial perturbation.
